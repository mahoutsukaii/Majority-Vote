== Summary: ==

Have there been times on your server when there aren't any Administrators online to handle users requests? Or if you went afk, and a spammer came online and there was nothing that could be done? The possibilities and needs for this plugin are endless.

Introducing the Vote!

Fully customised in a config file, players can perform any command for any other plugin, if they get the required votes.
All players need to do, is, for example, type /vote mute [player], and if it receives enough votes, the player would be muted.

=== Setting up: ===

There are two main steps in setting up this plugin. Permissions, and the config.yml file.

=== Config.yml ===

After running Majority Vote for the first time, a config.yml file will be generated in /plugins/MajorityVote/ with the default settings, and some examples of syntax.

The values for the settings, and a description are as follows:

minumumPercent: - What is the minimum percentage of players who vote yes on the server to allow the vote to pass?

minimumPlayers: - What is the absolute minimum number of players for the vote to pass?

timeout: - If this amount of time passes (in seconds), the vote will timeout and not be passed.


Adding new commands:

under the node Commands, you can add your own custom commands, used in other plugins. Following the examples, you can see each command has a command and a description. The command is what the console will execute if the vote has been passed. There is one variable available, %arg%, which can be set from /vote [command] %arg%.

An example for a mute vote would be:


commands:
    mute:
        command: mute %arg% 10 minutes You have been vote muted!
        description: mute a player for 10 minutes.


The description can be set to anything you like.

A list of the available commands to use with vote can be found in game by typing /vote.

Permissions

There are 3 nodes to use with Majority Vote.

majorityvote.startvote - is the player allowed to start a vote?

majorityvote.input - is the player allowed to vote?

majorityvote.stop - is the player allowed to overrule, and stop the vote?

=== Final Notes: ===

Remember, any command can be used, there are no defaults, and there must be a plugin to support that command.
